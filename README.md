# unic_xid_updater

This is an automated process for updating the [unicode-rs /
unicode-xid](https://github.com/unicode-rs/unicode-xid) repository when a new
unicode version is released.

It is currently scheduled to run once a day and will open a pull request on
that repo if a new version of unicode is released
